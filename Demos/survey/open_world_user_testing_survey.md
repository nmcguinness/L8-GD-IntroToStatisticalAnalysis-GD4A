# Aetherwild User Test Survey (Fake)

## Section 0 — Introduction (read before you start)

**Title:** Aetherwild (Open-World Prototype) – User Test Survey  
**Version:** Prototype Build A / Build B (internal test)  
**Estimated time:** 3–5 minutes  

### Purpose of this test
You are helping the team evaluate:
- **Navigation clarity** (finding objectives, reading the map/UI)
- **Combat feel** (fun and fairness)
- **Quest/task completion** (can players complete key tasks)
- Overall **frustration** and **recommendation**

This is a prototype. We’re testing the game, not you.

### Consent
By continuing, you confirm that:
- you are happy for your responses to be used for teaching and analysis in this module
- you understand you can stop at any time

### Data storage and privacy (teaching context)
- We store your answers in an **anonymous dataset** used for coursework.
- We do **not** collect your name, email, or phone number.
- Responses are stored in a password-protected folder accessible to the teaching team.
- Data will be retained until the end of the semester, then deleted (for this fake exercise).

### What you did in the play session (for context)
During the session you attempted three tasks:
- **Task 1 (Navigation):** reach the marked shrine on the map.
- **Task 2 (Quest Objective):** find the quest NPC and complete the objective step.
- **Task 3 (Combat Encounter):** defeat (or escape) the bandit camp encounter.

During play, we recorded:
- whether each task was completed
- time-to-complete (if completed)
- total deaths
- bugs noticed
- total session time

## Section 1 — Session metadata

> Some fields are **facilitator-only** (recorded during the test). Others are answered by the player.

### Facilitator-only fields

1) **Respondent ID** *(respondent_id)*  
- Short code like `R01`, `R02`, etc.  
*(Text field; facilitator assigns)*

2) **Build Tested** *(build)*  
- A  
- B  

3) **Platform** *(platform)*  
- PC  
- Console  

### Player field

4) **Your experience with open-world action games** *(experience_band)*  
- Beginner (rarely play open-world/action games)  
- Intermediate (play occasionally)  
- Experienced (play regularly / familiar with conventions)

## Section 2 — Timing & task outcomes (mostly facilitator-logged)

5) **Total session length (minutes)** *(session_minutes)*  
*(Number; facilitator records)*

### Task 1 (Navigation – shrine)
6) **Did the player complete Task 1?** *(task1_complete)*  
- Yes (1)  
- No (0)  

7) **If yes, time to complete Task 1 (seconds)** *(task1_time_sec)*  
*(Number; blank if not completed)*

### Task 2 (Quest objective – find NPC + step)
8) **Did the player complete Task 2?** *(task2_complete)*  
- Yes (1)  
- No (0)  

9) **If yes, time to complete Task 2 (seconds)** *(task2_time_sec)*  
*(Number; blank if not completed)*

### Task 3 (Combat encounter)
10) **Did the player complete Task 3?** *(task3_complete)*  
- Yes (1)  
- No (0)  

11) **If yes, time to complete Task 3 (seconds)** *(task3_time_sec)*  
*(Number; blank if not completed)*

---

## Section 3 — Gameplay outcomes

12) **How many times did you die during the session?** *(deaths_total)*  
*(Number; 0+)*

13) **How many bugs or obvious technical issues did you notice?** *(bugs_reported)*  
*(Number; 0+)*

**Bug definition:** something broken or clearly unintended (clipping, stuck, UI wrong, animation broken, quest logic not updating, etc.)

## Section 4 — Short ratings (1–7 scale)

**Scale (1–7):**  
1 = Strongly disagree  
2 = Disagree  
3 = Slightly disagree  
4 = Neither agree nor disagree  
5 = Slightly agree  
6 = Agree  
7 = Strongly agree  

14) **The UI clearly communicated what I should do next.** *(ui_clarity_1to7)*  
(1–7)

15) **Navigation felt intuitive (finding places, reading the map/markers).** *(navigation_1to7)*  
(1–7)

16) **Combat was enjoyable.** *(combat_fun_1to7)*  
(1–7)

17) **I felt frustrated while playing.** *(frustration_1to7)*  
(1–7)  
*Note: higher = more frustrated*

## Section 5 — Recommendation (0–10)

18) **How likely are you to recommend Aetherwild to a friend (based on this prototype)?** *(recommend_0to10)*  
0 = Not at all likely … 10 = Extremely likely

---

## Section 6 — Free-text feedback

19) **In one or two sentences, what was the biggest issue you noticed?** *(free_text)*  
*(Short paragraph)*

## Optional facilitator notes (not in the dataset, but useful in real life)

If you want to model good practice, capture:
- control scheme used (KBM/controller layout)
- whether the player read instructions
- confusion moments (what happened + when)
- bug details (what, where, reproducible?)
- player quotes

This helps explain *why* players behaved a certain way, not just what the numbers say.
